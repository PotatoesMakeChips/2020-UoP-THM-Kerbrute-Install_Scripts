# Try Hack Me Kerbrute Install Scripts
#### Useful scripts for installing stuff
I found TryHackMe to be a pain to install anything complex using apt so thease scripts download and install the things that I've had dificulty with in the past. This script was writen so that I could use kerbrute on a TryHackMe image that didn't have it insalled by default. It's not mainteaind as I don't need it anymore but to summerise it's function, it builds kerbrute and go from source. go was built from source as a supported version was also missing form the TryHackMe imagae we were using.
